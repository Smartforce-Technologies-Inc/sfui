## Development tools

- We have based our react components library on [create-react-library](https://js.coach/package/create-react-library) project.
- We have based ours react components on [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) library. Also we have used:
  - [Material-UI Pickers](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/), using [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to handle dates.
  - [Material Table](https://material-table.com/).
- We have added the svg icon library [icon54](https://icon54.com/) based on [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) project.
- We have added [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to test isolated components.
- We have added support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language.
- We have added support for [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Css Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
